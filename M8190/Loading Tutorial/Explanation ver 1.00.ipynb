During this playing_time the DAQ will also record the voltage input data from the channel given by DAQ_Settings1['Analog Channel Input Waveform']. When the playing time is finished, the DAQ box will stop the data acquisition and triggering of the AWG, meanwhile the csv files of the Cycles at the next sweeping step will be loaded into the AWG and the triggerin + data aquisition is repeated. At the end, the data recorded at each step is storaged in the file path given by PulseScheme_A['Measurement file Path'], this function also provides at the en the averaged value of all the data taken in the playing_time lapse for each individual step."
